description: Integrate a Property Management System (PMS) with the Channex channel manager API (channex.io) so availability, rates, and restrictions flow out to OTAs (Booking.com, Airbnb, Expedia, VRBO) and OTA bookings flow back in. Use this whenever the user wants to connect their PMS, hotel software, hostel system, or vacation-rental platform to Channex or to OTAs through a channel manager — including pushing ARI (availability/rates/inventory), receiving or syncing channel bookings, building a channel-manager integration, preparing for Channex PMS certification, or debugging an existing Channex integration. Apply it even when the user doesn't name Channex explicitly but mentions distributing inventory to booking channels via a channel manager API.

# Integrate a PMS with Channex

Channex (https://channex.io) is a channel manager: the PMS pushes
availability/rates/restrictions (ARI) to it, Channex fans them out to
OTAs, and OTA bookings come back through a revisions feed. This skill
encodes a battle-tested integration architecture and the API knowledge
to build it into ANY PMS codebase, in whatever language the project
uses.

Read `references/api.md` before writing any client code — it has the
verified endpoint shapes, payload formats, and API quirks. Don't guess
payloads from memory; between this reference and the live docs
(https://docs.channex.io — append `.md` to any page URL for clean
markdown; `https://docs.channex.io/sitemap.md` lists every page) you
can confirm everything.

## Before writing code: map their PMS

The integration is a translation layer, so first learn the PMS's shape.
Find (in code, or ask the user):

1. **Room model.** Channex sells _room types_ with a `count_of_rooms`,
   not individual rooms. If the PMS tracks individual rooms, you'll
   aggregate: availability = rooms of type − rooms occupied that night,
   and inbound bookings need a room-assignment step.
2. **Rate source.** Where does "the price for room type X on date D"
   come from? A rate table? A formula (base × season × weekday)?
   Manual overrides? Channex needs a concrete number per date.
3. **Money units.** Channex rates are in MINOR units (cents). Convert
   at the API boundary only — never let two money conventions leak
   through the codebase.
4. **Booking model.** What's the minimal write path for "create a
   booking with guest, dates, price, source=OTA"? Prefer the PMS's
   existing domain functions over raw inserts so audit/eventing
   logic still runs.
5. **Change signals.** How does the PMS announce "a booking changed" /
   "a price changed" (events, hooks, pub/sub, triggers)? This drives
   real-time pushes. If there's nothing, plan a polling/diff fallback
   and tell the user about the tradeoff.

Also ask: staging or production? (staging.channex.io vs
app.channex.io) and get an API key (Channex dashboard → user settings
→ API keys). **Keys are secrets**: env vars / gitignored .env only,
and check the repo isn't public before letting any credential near a
committed file.

## The four components

Build and verify them in this order — each one is independently
testable against staging before the next exists.

### 1. API client

A thin HTTP wrapper: `user-api-key` header, JSON, unwrap the
`{"data": ...}` envelope, normalize errors (`{"errors": {code,
title, details}}`), modest retries on transient failures. Make the
transport stubbable for tests in whatever way is idiomatic for the
stack. Verify: `GET /properties` returns 200 with the key.

### 2. ID mapping + content sync

Channex assigns UUIDs to the property, room types, and rate plans.
Persist a mapping table in the PMS database:

    (kind, local_id) → channex_id      kinds: property, room_type,
                                       rate_plan, booking

Content sync upserts the property → room types → rate plans (in that
dependency order): POST when no mapping exists, PUT when it does, and
store the returned UUID. This makes the sync idempotent — safe to
re-run forever. The `booking` kind serves double duty later: dedupe of
inbound revisions and lookup for cancellations.

**Start with ONE rate plan per room type** (the PMS's standard/default
price). Multi-plan sync multiplies every downstream push and confuses
users whose PMS UI shows a single price; add plans only when the PMS
actually models them. Make the choice configurable.

Verify: read back `/room_types` and `/rate_plans` filtered by the
property and confirm titles/counts match the PMS.

### 3. Outbound ARI push

Two endpoints, separate messages: `POST /availability` (per room
type) and `POST /restrictions` (per rate plan: rate, min_stay,
stop_sell, closed_to_arrival, closed_to_departure).

Non-negotiables learned the hard way:

- **Compress ranges.** Sending one value per date for a year is
  thousands of entries. Run-length encode: consecutive dates with
  equal values become one `date_from`/`date_to` entry. (Compare the
  whole value object, not just the rate.)
- **Push deltas, not the world.** Scope every push to what changed:
  - booking created/moved/cancelled → availability only (cheap after
    compression — bookings don't change prices)
  - a price/restriction edit → restrictions for the touched
    room-type/date cells only, and **only the changed fields** —
    Channex applies partial updates, so a price edit can send `{rate}`
    alone without clobbering min-stay/closures
  - property/room-type/rate-plan config change → full push
  - plus a periodic (e.g. hourly) full push as drift correction, so
    no missed event can desynchronize you forever
- **Debounce.** Coalesce a burst of edits (one save = many events in
  most PMSs) into one push a few seconds later, through a job queue
  with retries rather than inline HTTP in a request handler.
- **Never send past dates** — Channex rejects them.
- **Availability semantics:** count holds/blocks as occupied (they're
  not sellable), exclude cancelled bookings, clamp negatives
  (overbooked) to 0.

Verify with a READBACK, not by trusting the 200: `GET /availability`
and `GET /restrictions?...&filter[restrictions]=rate` for sample dates
and compare against locally computed values. (The `filter[restrictions]`
param is required on restrictions reads — you get a 400 without it.)

### 4. Inbound bookings

Channex delivers OTA bookings as _revisions_. There are two delivery
mechanisms; they share the same apply-then-ack core and the same
30-minute expiry, and the robust setup uses both:

- **Feed polling (simplest — start here).** Poll
  `GET /booking_revisions/feed` (every minute is conventional), apply
  each revision, ack with `POST /booking_revisions/:id/ack`.
- **Webhooks (low-latency push).** Register a callback with
  `POST /webhooks` (`event_mask: "booking_new;booking_modification;
booking_cancellation"` or `"*"`, `property_id` or null for global).
  On a booking event Channex POSTs you
  `{event, payload: {booking_id, property_id, revision_id}, user_id,
timestamp}` — note it carries the `revision_id`, not the full
  booking. The expected flow is: take that `revision_id` →
  `GET /booking_revisions/:id` to pull the authoritative payload →
  apply → ack. (Webhooks can set `send_data: true` to include the body,
  but pulling by id is the recommended pattern — the webhook is a
  notification, the pull is the source of truth.)

These are complementary, not either/or: a webhook can be missed (your
endpoint down, a network blip), so even with webhooks, keep a feed poll
as the backstop. **Every ~15 minutes is the sweet spot** — that's two
poll cycles inside the 30-minute expiry window, so a missed webhook is
still caught with margin even if one poll cycle also slips. (If you're
feed-only with no webhooks, poll faster — every minute — since the feed
is then your only real-time path.) The `user_id` in the payload is the
actor; it lets you ignore events your own pushes caused.

Either way, `GET /booking_revisions/:id` fetches one revision by id, and
the same rules keep ingestion robust:

- **The feed is a 30-minute window, NOT a durable queue.** An unacked
  revision is re-served for only ~30 minutes (with a warning email),
  then it DROPS OUT of the feed for good. So the feed alone is not a
  safe system of record — anything you fail to ack within 30 minutes
  (poller outage, deploy, a bug that crashes processing) is gone from
  the feed and will never redeliver. The defense is to keep the poller
  healthy and ack promptly (below), and to _monitor_ it so a >30-min
  stall is itself an alert.
- **Drain until empty; don't fall behind the page limit.** The feed
  returns oldest-first and defaults to `limit: 10`. If more than 10
  revisions are waiting (`meta.total > meta.limit`), loop immediately
  rather than waiting for the next tick — a surge (channel backfill,
  reconnect dump) can otherwise outrun a once-per-minute poll and push
  revisions toward the 30-minute cliff. Staying drained is the real
  protection; recovery (below) is the unhappy path.
- **Ack only after applying successfully — but a failure can't block
  the queue OR sit unhandled.** Leave a failed revision un-acked so it
  retries within the window, but keep draining the rest (don't `break`
  on first error), and alert on it — because the 30-minute expiry means
  a poison revision you ignore becomes permanent loss, not indefinite
  retry. Loud alerting is how you fix the cause before the window
  closes.
- **Recovery after a real outage is MANUAL and time-scoped, not a
  cron.** Do NOT run a periodic full booking-list sweep "just in case"
  — it re-pulls the same bookings endlessly and is heavy on both
  sides for no benefit while the poller is healthy. Instead, build a
  one-shot recovery you trigger _after_ a known >30-min gap: list
  `GET /bookings?filter[inserted_at][gte]=<outage_start>` (paginated),
  and create anything the PMS is missing (deduped by Channex booking
  id), reusing the same apply logic as the feed. Scoping to bookings
  created since the outage keeps it cheap. (If your Channex account
  exposes an unacked filter on the revisions list, that's an even more
  scoped recovery source — confirm it exists before relying on it; the
  public docs present the feed as the only unacked view.)
- **The feed is account-wide.** ONE call covers every property the key
  can see (optional `filter[property_id]` exists but you don't need it
  for normal polling). Skip-and-ack revisions for property ids that
  aren't in your mapping table, or stray test properties on the
  account will wedge the poller.
- Revision statuses: `new` → create local booking; `cancelled` → find
  via the booking mapping and cancel; `modified` → safest default is
  log + ack + notify a human, because blindly applying OTA
  modifications (date/room/price changes) to a live calendar needs
  reconciliation UX the PMS probably doesn't have yet. Say so to the
  user instead of silently auto-applying.
- **Never drop an OTA booking.** If the PMS tracks individual rooms
  and none is free, ingest anyway into a flagged/overbooked state —
  a guest with a Booking.com confirmation exists whether or not the
  PMS likes it.
- Dedupe by Channex booking id via the mapping table — feeds can
  resend.
- Map money from major-unit strings ("230.00") into the PMS's money
  type; map `ota_name` into the PMS's source field; keep
  `ota_reservation_code` — staff need it on the phone with the OTA.

Whichever delivery mechanism you use (or both), the 30-minute expiry is
the same — so the mandatory parts are: keep the poller/webhook handler
healthy + monitored, ack promptly, drain-until-empty, and keep the
manual time-scoped `GET /bookings` recovery ready for the rare outage.

## Connecting OTA channels (the Channel API)

Connecting an OTA (Booking.com, etc.) to the property can be done in the
Channex dashboard, OR — if the account has **Channel API access**
(historically Whitelabel-gated; the first `test_connection` call tells
you) — programmatically via the `/channels` endpoints, so the PMS can
offer its own "connect a channel" flow. The shapes are in
`references/api.md`; the flow and its traps:

1. **Test the OTA credentials** — `POST /channels/test_connection`
   (`{channel, settings: {hotel_id}}`) before anything else; `hotel_id`
   is the OTA's property id (Booking.com extranet id).
2. **Read the OTA's rooms/rates** — `POST /channels/mapping_details`.
   For Booking.com this returns `rooms[].rates[]` (note: `rooms`/`rates`,
   not room_types/rate_plans), each room/rate keyed by an **integer**
   code, each rate carrying `pricing` ("OBP" occupancy-based / "PP"
   per-person), `max_persons`, `occupancies`.
3. **Map** each OTA room+rate to one of your rate plans and **create**
   the channel — `POST /channels` with a `rate_plans` array of
   `{rate_plan_id, settings: {room_type_code, rate_plan_code, occupancy,
pricing_type, primary_occ}}`.
4. **Activate** — channels are created **inactive**; `POST
/channels/:id/activate` goes live (`/deactivate` pauses).

Traps (all confirmed against staging):

- **Codes are integers.** `room_type_code`/`rate_plan_code` come back as
  integers — send them as integers. Strings make Channex file the
  mapping under "removed rates" and the OTA side shows "Not mapped". (UI
  `<select>` values are strings → match by string, store the integer.)
- **`group_id` is required** on create and must be one the account can
  access, else `422 "You not have access to requested group"`. Fetch
  `GET /groups` and pick the group that owns your property.
- **No duplicate mappings** — one OTA room+rate pair maps to at most one
  of your rate plans; reject duplicates before create.
- **Delete needs an inactive channel** — `DELETE /channels/:id` returns
  `422 {"channel": ["is active"]}` if live, so deactivate first.
- **Readback-first.** `mapping_details`/per-person restriction shapes
  aren't fully in the public docs and vary by OTA — call them against a
  test hotel id and inspect the real JSON before trusting a parser. Use
  a THROWAWAY rate plan/channel for shape-probing and delete it, so a
  real connected channel isn't disturbed. (Booking.com test hotel ids
  from the cert guide are shared across integrators — create may 422 as
  already used.)
- **Per-person pricing** changes the rate plan (`sell_mode: per_person`,
  one `options` entry per occupancy) AND the ARI: restrictions then take
  a `rates` ARRAY of `{occupancy, rate}` (not a scalar `rate`). See
  `references/api.md`.

## Verification & ongoing health

People trust channel managers with real money — build the checker, not
just the integration:

- A **sync command** (CLI/task) for the initial content sync, runnable
  again safely.
- A **doctor command** that checks: key configured → API reachable →
  every local room type/rate plan has a mapping → sampled
  availability/rates match a live readback → feed reachable + pending
  count → last push job state. Exit non-zero on failure so CI can run
  it. This catches drift that no amount of "the push returned 200"
  can.
- **Testing inbound:** there is NO API to inject test bookings. In the
  Channex dashboard: Applications → add the "Booking CRS" app → create
  a booking manually; it arrives via the feed within a minute. Walk
  the user through this — then cancel it and confirm the cancellation
  flows too.
- For go-live, OTA channel mapping is done either in the Channex
  dashboard or via the Channel API (see "Connecting OTA channels"
  above), and Channex runs PMS certification tests:
  https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests.md

## Common traps

- Trusting memory for payload shapes → use `references/api.md` and the
  live `.md` docs.
- Testing rate pushes by checking your own logs instead of a readback.
- One full 365-day push wired to every change event (works in a demo,
  hammers the API in production).
- Two sources of price truth: if the PMS UI shows a different number
  than what's pushed, that's a bug to fix BEFORE connecting OTAs —
  unify them so what staff see is exactly what guests pay.
- Committing the API key to a public repo template.
- Letting in-memory state (caches, unsaved overrides) feed pushes —
  anything that feeds Channex must survive a restart, or document
  loudly that it doesn't yet.
